# Snake Game (JAVA)


A simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java's Swing library. This game features basic mechanics such as snake movement, apple consumption, and collision detection.

## Project Structure

- `Controller/GameController.java`: Manages the game logic, including starting the game, moving the snake, and checking for collisions.
- `UI/GamePanel.java`: Renders the game board, handles user input, and updates the display.
- `UI/StartPanel.java`: Displays the start screen and transitions to the game panel.
- `Entity/Apple.java`: Represents the apple entity in the game.
- `Entity/Snake.java`: Represents the snake entity in the game.
- `domain/Configs.java`: Contains configuration constants for screen size, unit size, delay, etc.
- `domain/Direction.java`: Enum for defining the direction of the snake's movement.
- `domain/Mode.java`: Interface for defining panel modes.
